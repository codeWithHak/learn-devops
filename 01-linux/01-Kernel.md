# Linux

## Linux Kernal
It's an interface that lets our system's hardware and it's processes (softwares) communicate with each other.

It exists within the OS and control all the major functions of the hardware.

It's a layer between your hardware and softwareit signals the hardware what to do.

E.G:
Accepts requests from software (like “read this file” or “send this data over the network”)

Talks directly to the hardware to make it happen

Then sends the result back up to the software layer
